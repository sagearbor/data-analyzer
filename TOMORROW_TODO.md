# Quick Start for Tomorrow Morning

## Status: âœ… WORKING
**URL:** https://aidemo.dcri.duke.edu/sageapp02/
**Containers:** 2 running (data-analyzer-prod + nginx-helper)

---

## Quick Check Commands

```bash
cd /home/scb2/PROJECTS/gitRepos/data-analyzer

# Check if still running
docker compose ps

# View logs if issues
docker compose logs -f

# Restart if needed
docker compose restart
```

---

## What Got Fixed Today

**Problem:** App loaded but froze, WebSocket errors in browser console

**Root Cause:** Main NGINX strips `/sageapp02/` prefix, but Streamlit needs it for WebSocket URLs

**Solution:** Added lightweight helper NGINX container that:
1. Receives requests from main NGINX (without /sageapp02/ prefix)
2. Adds /sageapp02/ prefix back
3. Forwards to Streamlit app

**Flow:**
```
Browser â†’ Main NGINX â†’ Helper NGINX â†’ Streamlit
         (strips)      (adds back)
```

## Tomorrow's Investigation

### Compare with Port 3001 (byod-synthetic-generator)

**Why:** Port 3001 works without a helper NGINX - might be simpler approach

**Questions to answer:**
1. Where is the byod-synthetic-generator project located?
2. What framework does it use? (FastAPI, Flask, etc.)
3. How does its docker-compose.yml differ from ours?
4. Does it handle WebSockets differently?
5. Can we simplify our setup by copying its approach?

**Search commands:**
```bash
# Find the project
find /home/scb2 -name "*byod*" -type d 2>/dev/null

# Check container details
docker inspect byod-synthetic-generator | grep -A 10 "Image"
docker port byod-synthetic-generator

# If you find the project directory:
cd <byod-project-dir>
cat docker-compose.yml
cat Dockerfile
```
