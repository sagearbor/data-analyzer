# Notes for AI Agents
ai_instructions:
  update_process: |
    When working on tasks:
    1. Change status from TODO to INPROGRESS when starting
    2. Add detailed notes about what's been done and what remains
    3. Update subtasks individually if present
    4. Change to DONE only when fully complete and tested
    5. Update last_updated field at top of file

  example_inprogress_note: |
    INPROGRESS:
    - Completed: Basic JSON loading functionality
    - Completed: Unit tests for JSON loader
    - Remaining: UI integration for JSON config
    - Remaining: Handle deeply nested structures
    - Blocked: Waiting for MCP client integration (core_1)

  priority_guide:
    CRITICAL: "Blocks other work or breaks core functionality"
    HIGH: "Important for release or heavily requested"
    MEDIUM: "Nice to have, improves user experience"
    LOW: "Future enhancement, not urgent"
