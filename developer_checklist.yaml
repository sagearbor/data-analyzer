  estimated_time: "10-12 hours total"

  notes: |
    CRITICAL: Fix JSON support bug first - user reported this is broken!
    Then ensure all core functionality works before UI improvements.
    Focus on making the UI clean, professional, and less cluttered.
    Priority is reducing scrolling and improving visual hierarchy.
    The download feature with error highlighting is a key differentiator.

# AI Agent Instructions
ai_instructions:
  approach: |
    1. Start with ui_cleanup_1 through ui_cleanup_3 for maximum impact
    2. Use streamlit native components where possible
    3. Add streamlit-aggrid only for schema editor
    4. Test each change before moving to next task
    5. Commit after each major task completion
    6. Focus on user experience over perfect code

  style_guide: |
    - Use consistent spacing (st.markdown("&nbsp;") for gaps)
    - Apply color coding: green=success, yellow=warning, red=error
    - Use icons from emoji set consistently
    - Keep sidebar width reasonable (don't overcrowd)
    - Ensure all text is readable (good contrast)

  testing: |
    - Test with demo data after each change
    - Verify no functionality is broken
    - Check responsive design at different widths
    - Ensure loading states work properly
